# Learning project 1 - Interactive Dictionary
The Interactive Dictionary app allows user to look up for an explanation of an english word on a database using a command line interface. If the user puts in a word with a typo, the program search the most similar word in a database and asks the user if it was the one he or she wanted to search and then returns the meaning.
